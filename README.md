# EBV EML profile [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/190021681.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/190021681)

Version v0.5 of the EBV Metadata Profile XSD schema.

Version v0.5 is focused on species-level EBVs, especially on the species populations EBV class, and maybe equally applicable to the species traits EBV class.
 

However, this version doesn´t cover other EBV classes related to ecosystem function/structure or community composition and genetic composition.
These classes will need some additional terms as well as have no need for some current terms (e.g. taxonomic coverage). 
For instance, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure EBVs will need some other dimension than taxonomy, e.g. fields related to what type of ecosystems and habitats are captured.

You will find more information about the EBV classes on [geobon.org/ebvs](https://geobon.org/ebvs/what-are-ebvs/#ebv-classes)
